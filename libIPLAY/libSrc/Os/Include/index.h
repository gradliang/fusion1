/// The iPlay RTOS is a simple but efficient operating system
/// designed by MagicPixel for all the intelligent, versatile devices that powered by MagicPixel's IC.
///
/// The basic concept of the iPlay RTOS is derived from the uITRON 3.0. Consider to the tiny code size
/// and the limited resource, some of the functions defined in the uITRON 3.0 has been eliminated.
/// And, in the other way, some additional functions has been implemented in order to support more
/// efficient application.
///
