 * IRQ flags tracing: follow the state of the hardirq and softirq flags and
 * provide callbacks for transitions between ON and OFF states.
 *
 * This file gets included from lowlevel asm headers too, to provide
 * wrapped versions of the local_irq_*() APIs, based on the
 * raw_local_irq_*() macros from the lowlevel headers.
