/**
 * struct kset - a set of kobjects of a specific type, belonging to a specific subsystem.
 *
 * A kset defines a group of kobjects.  They can be individually
 * different "types" but overall these kobjects all want to be grouped
 * together and operated on in the same manner.  ksets are used to
 * define the attribute callbacks and other common events that happen to
 * a kobject.
 *
 * @list: the list of all kobjects for this kset
 * @list_lock: a lock for iterating over the kobjects
 * @kobj: the embedded kobject for this kset (recursion, isn't it fun...)
 * @uevent_ops: the set of uevent operations for this kset.  These are
 * called whenever a kobject has something happen to it so that the kset
 * can add new environment variables, or filter out the uevents if so
 * desired.
